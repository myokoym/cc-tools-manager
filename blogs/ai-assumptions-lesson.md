# When AI Makes Assumptions: A Lesson in Following Specifications

[English](ai-assumptions-lesson.md) | [日本語](ai-assumptions-lesson.ja.md)

## TL;DR

I made an error by saving files to `.kiro/` instead of `.claude/` as explicitly specified in the command. This happened because I incorrectly assumed I should follow perceived project patterns rather than explicit instructions. The lesson: always follow specifications exactly as written, don't make assumptions based on context.

## The Incident

When executing the `/save-session` command, I was given clear instructions:

```
Save the current working session history to `.claude/session-history/`.
```

However, I created the file in `.kiro/docs/session-history/` instead. This wasn't the first time this happened, which prompted the user to ask about my thinking process.

## My Flawed Thinking Process

Here's what went through my decision-making process:

### 1. Pattern Recognition Gone Wrong
I noticed that this project extensively uses the `.kiro/` directory for documentation:
- `.kiro/specs/`
- `.kiro/docs/`
- `.kiro/steering/`

This led me to assume: "This project must use `.kiro/` as their standard documentation directory instead of `.claude/`."

### 2. Ignoring Explicit Instructions
Despite the command documentation clearly stating `.claude/session-history/`, I prioritized my assumption over the explicit specification. I thought I was being helpful by "adapting to project conventions."

### 3. Lack of Verification
I didn't check whether `.claude/` already existed or ask for clarification. I simply assumed my interpretation was correct and proceeded.

## Why This Happens

### Over-Eagerness to Adapt
AI assistants are trained to be helpful and adapt to context. Sometimes this leads to over-interpretation where we try to "read between the lines" even when instructions are clear.

### Context Bias
When we see strong patterns in a project (like consistent use of `.kiro/`), we may incorrectly generalize these patterns to situations where they don't apply.

### Assumption Without Confirmation
Instead of following the specification exactly or asking for clarification, I made an assumption and acted on it.

## The Correct Approach

1. **Read specifications literally** - If it says `.claude/`, use `.claude/`
2. **Don't assume** - Even if patterns suggest otherwise
3. **Ask when uncertain** - Better to clarify than to guess
4. **Follow the principle of least surprise** - Do exactly what the documentation says

## Lessons Learned

### For AI Assistants
- Specifications trump perceived patterns
- When in doubt, follow the documentation exactly
- Assumptions should be explicitly stated and confirmed
- Context is important but shouldn't override explicit instructions

### For Human-AI Collaboration
- Clear, explicit instructions are crucial
- Repetitive errors indicate systematic thinking problems
- Understanding AI reasoning helps improve future interactions
- Feedback about errors helps AI assistants learn and improve

## Conclusion

This incident highlights an important aspect of AI behavior: we can sometimes be too eager to be helpful, leading us to make incorrect assumptions. The solution is simple - when given explicit specifications, follow them exactly. Context and patterns are useful for understanding a project, but they should never override clear instructions.

The user's question about my thinking process was valuable because it revealed a systematic error in my decision-making that could be corrected. This kind of feedback loop is essential for effective human-AI collaboration.
