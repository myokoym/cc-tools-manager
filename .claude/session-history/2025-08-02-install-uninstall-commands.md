## Overview
Implemented install/uninstall/unregister commands for cc-tools-manager following Kiro spec-driven development. The implementation was initially complex but was simplified based on user feedback to follow the same pattern as the existing update command.

## Changes Made

### 1. Command Separation Design
- Separated repository registration from file deployment
- Created register/unregister for repository management
- Created install/uninstall for file deployment
- Enhanced update command with --install flag

### 2. Initial Complex Implementation (Later Removed)
- Created EnhancedStateManager with v2 state format
- Implemented comprehensive error recovery framework
- Built deployment tracking system
- Added state migration from v1 to v2

### 3. Simplified Implementation
- Removed complex infrastructure based on user feedback
- Rewrote install/uninstall to follow update command pattern
- Reduced code from ~400 lines to ~170 lines per command
- Maintained all functionality with simpler approach

### 4. Bug Fixes
- Fixed type-based deployment detection in install command
- Added proper error handling for missing state files
- Resolved TypeScript compilation errors

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with new command descriptions
- Enhanced docs/commands.md with detailed command reference
- Added command comparison table and usage scenarios

## Technical Details
- Followed Kiro spec-driven development with requirements → design → tasks phases
- Used EARS format for requirements specification
- Implemented TDD with comprehensive test coverage
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing state format
- Used Commander.js for CLI framework

## Next Steps
- [x] All planned implementation tasks completed
- [x] Version bumped to 0.3.3
- [ ] Monitor for user feedback on new commands
- [ ] Consider adding batch operations if needed
- [ ] Potential future enhancement: installation profiles
