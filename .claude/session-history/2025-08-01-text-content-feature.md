# Session History: Text Content Management Feature Implementation

Date: 2025-08-01

## Overview
Added functionality to Claude Code Package Manager (CCPM) to manage single text files (commands, agents, hooks) that are not GitHub repositories.

## Initial Approach (Complex Design)

Initially followed Kiro specification-driven development to create a detailed design:

- Multiple new classes (TextContentManager, TextContentEditor, TextContentDeployer, etc.)
- New dependencies (conf package)
- Completely independent subsystem

However, user raised concerns: "This looks very complex. Won't it bloat the build or affect other features? The main focus is still register url."

## Final Solution (Simple Design)

Pivoted to minimal implementation leveraging existing repository management system:

### 1. Virtual Repository Approach
- Treat text content as virtual repositories with `text://` protocol
- Reuse existing registry system

### 2. Implemented Changes
- `register command`: Support for `ccpm register text`
- `edit command`: New command for editing text content
- `RegistryService`: Added text:// URL validation
- `GitManager`: Create dummy repository with `git init` for text://
- `DeploymentService`: Added text content deployment handling

### 3. Implementation Benefits
- No new dependencies
- Existing list/show/remove/update commands work as-is
- Minimal impact on build size

## Problems Encountered and Solutions

### Problem 1: URL Validation Error
- `text://commit.md` rejected as invalid URL
- Solution: Added `.` to regex pattern

### Problem 2: Repository Path Handling
- GitManager couldn't process text:// paths correctly
- Solution: Added text:// support to `extractRepoName` method

### Problem 3: Git Operation Errors
- Git operations failed on text:// repositories
- Solution: Initialize as dummy Git repository with `git init`

### Problem 4: .md Extension Handling
- Users unaware that .md is automatically appended
- Solution: Explicitly state in prompts

## Final Features

```bash
# Register text content
ccpm register text
# Enter name and type, then editor opens

# Edit
ccpm edit my-command

# Deploy
ccpm update my-command

# List (integrated with repositories)
ccpm list

# Remove
ccpm remove my-command
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Simplicity is Key**: Simple implementation leveraging existing systems proved better than complex initial design
2. **User Feedback Value**: "Too complex" feedback was the turning point to better design
3. **Code Reuse**: Maximizing existing code reuse maintains consistency and maintainability
